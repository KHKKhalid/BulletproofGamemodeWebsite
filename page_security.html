<h2>It is secure</h2>

<p>
It's really enough to say that Bulletproof has no secret commands at all. There are no backdoors. No exploits.
You will never have strangers entering your server, promoting themselves, and then leave like nothing happened.
Bulletproof gamemode guarantees privacy, safety and security.
