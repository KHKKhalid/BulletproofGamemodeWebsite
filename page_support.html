<h2>It is always up-to-date. Strong support</h2>
<p>
	Bulletproof undoubtedly wins when it comes to support, receiving updates, maintenance and servicing. 
	Being an open-source gamemode, it's got one hell of a swift development life cycle since development is not 
	tied up to anyone specifically which means everyone is free to contribute, collaborate and make progress. 
	You get important updates in no time.
